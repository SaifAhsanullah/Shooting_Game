Shooting_Game
=============

Game created using XNA and C#
There are many different folders and files to this game.  Explore them and see what you guys would like to modify. I 
created this game for a class I took online that taught me how to use Visual Studio and the XNA game engine to create this.
Over time the game has eveolved from what the instructor showed us.
